# tuyaOrchestrator

This repository contains a simple Java example for orchestrating Tuya devices. The provided code demonstrates how to read the temperature from two Tuya sensors and close a set of Tuya shutters if the first sensor reports a higher temperature than the second.

The main example can be found in [`src/main/java/com/example/tuya/TemperatureController.java`](src/main/java/com/example/tuya/TemperatureController.java).
